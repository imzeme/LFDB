RoManager is a free, feature-rich Discord-to-Roblox bot. This repository (https://github.com/RoManager-org/romanager-oss) is the self-hosted version.

## Release Schedule
The self-hosted version will catch up with the `main` branch of the upstream bot every month. We recommend you update the bot (`git pull`) every now and then.

## Setup
~~Instructions to start your own instance of RoManager are in the wiki: https://github.com/RoManager-org/romanager-oss/wiki.~~ (not yet complete)

## Security

## Contribute
We accept any kind of contributions! They will also be added to the public version of RoManager.

### Developing on RoManager
Requirements:
* Node.js v16 or higher.
* npm 7 or higher
* PostgreSQL

1. Populate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
2. Install dependencies using `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`
3. Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript
4. Run `npm run migrate:dev` to apply the schema to the database
5. Start the bot with `node .`

When making changes to the TS files, run `npm run build` afterwards to compile the changes to JavaScript.

When you make changes to the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, run `npm run db:push` to quickly test the changes.
